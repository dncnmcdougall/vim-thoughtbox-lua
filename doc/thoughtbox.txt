COMMANDS                                                    *thoughtbox-command*

                                                                         *:NewThought*
:NewThought [name]
    Creates and opens a new thought file in |g:thoughtbox#folder| under the
    [name] given. If no name is given a new top-level name is chosen.  See
    |thought-naming| for details.

                                                                    *:ListThoughts*
:ListThoughts
    Opens the thoughtlist in a split and list all the thoughts. The behaviour
    of this split is controlled by the settings.

                                                                        *:ListThoughtTags*
:ListThoughtTags 
    Opens the thoughtlist in a split and list all the thoughts, grouped by
    tags. The behaviour of this split is controlled by the settings.

                                                                       *:SearchThoughts*
:SearchThoughts 
    List all the thoughts in an FZF search.
    Only available if |g:thoughtbox#fzf|=1

===============================================================================
SETTINGS                                                   *thoughtbox-settings*

                                                           *g:thoughtbox#folder*
g:thoughtbox#folder = '~/thoughtbox'
    The folder to store thoughts in. New thoughts are created in here, and
    this is searched fro thoughts.

                                                   *g:thoughtbox#vertical_split*
g:thoughtbox#vertical_split = 1
    If this is 1 (default) then using |:ListThoughts| performs a vertical split to
    display the thoughtlist. Otherwise, if set to 0, a horizontal split is used.

                                                         *g:thoughtbox#open_pos*
g:thoughtbox#open_pos = 'botright'
    This governs the position of where the split is opened. Other options
    include |topleft| and so on. See |E36| for more options.

                                                       *g:thoughtbox#split_size*
g:thoughtbox#split_size = 40
    This governs the width (in vertical split) or height (in horizontal split)
    of the thoughtlist.

                                                  *g:thoughtbox#list_auto_close*
g:thoughtbox#list_auto_close = 1
    If set to 1 (default) then the thought list will close when the cursor
    leave it, or when a thought is opened.

                                             *g:thoughtbox#jump_to_list_on_open*
g:thoughtbox#jump_to_list_on_open = 1
    If set to 1 (default) then the cursor is moved to the thoughtlist once it
    is opened.
    TODO: Not having this 1 will result is weird problems!

                                                              *g:thoughtbox#fzf*
g:thoughtbox#fzf = 1
    This enables populating a FZF search with the list of thoughts.
    This enables the command |:SearchThoughts|
